<h3>brief summary of the application’s architecture, business and technical features</h3>
<p>
Our project has two types of senders and receivers:
  <li>producer and consumer (with focus on topic)</li>
  <li>requestor and replier (with focus on rpc)</li>
  
  The topic part has to do with getting a list of food-categories and then filter the larger
  amount of data into a smaller chosen amount of data by using a routing_key.
  
  The rpc part follows the business process model and has to do with first picking a food category,
  then picking a food and then finally pay/not pay.
  
  
  this application processes a larger of amount of data in CSV and JSON format.
  
  <ul>
  <li>message broker: rabbitMQ</li>
  <li>programming language: java 11</li>
  <li>dependecy manager: maven</li>
</ul>
